            <!-- Brief Biography -->
            <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
            <p>
                I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Nazarbayev University in Astana, Kazakhstan, graduating with Magna Cum Laude honors. Throughout my studies, 
                I was fortunate to receive several prestigious scholarships, including the State Grant Scholarship (full tuition waiver with a monthly stipend), Mereke Scholarship, President’s Stipend, 
                and the DAAD Scholarship.

                My primary research interests are in robotic perception and learning, focusing on developing effective methods to extract and utilize tactile and video data, 
                enabling robots to learn and adapt from these inputs.

                Outside of academics, I enjoy rock climbing, playing basketball, and spending quality time with friends.
